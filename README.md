# My Dotfiles

I do the majority of my development using Tmux and vim/neovim.

Back in about 2017 when I was working at `everydayhero` (when I first transitioned from using Sublime2 to using vim as my primary editor) my coworkers introduced me to this project called [fresh](https://github.com/freshshell/fresh). Fresh made it easy to import dotfiles from other people's repositories and to have the files from my dotfiles repository moved into the appropriate locations on my local workstation. Over time I stopped importing dotfiles from other people's repositories since it took more effort to understand their configurations and overwrite them when I didn't like their choices, than to just write my own from scratch. I decided to stop using fresh altogether.

Currently I have my dotfiles checked out in a predictable location with a script called `not_fresh.sh` that copies the dotfiles into the appropriate locations. Most of the files it copies are filled with statements to `source` configurations directly in the dotfiles folder. I would like to migrate away from this strategy and instead used XDG configuration options where the majority of configuration files are kept in a directory at `~/.config`. Then I can simply checkout this repository into that folder. I have not implimented this plan yet since I have been focusing on improving the actual configurations for neovim since I recently switched from using vim.
